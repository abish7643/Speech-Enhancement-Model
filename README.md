# Speech Enhancement Model

## ⚡ Features
- Uses Deep Learning Model based on GRUs
- Low Complexity Model For Hearing Aid Related Applications
- Uses MFCCs and Pitch Correlation as Input Features
- Implementation Using Python

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Installation
1. Install python3 and python3-venv 
   ```sh
   sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-tk
   ```
   > python3-tk is used by Matplotlib for displaying plots
2. Create Virtual Environment
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate The Virtual Environment
    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install the required Python Dependencies
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Alternatively, the required libraries can be installed by
   ```sh
   pip3 install librosa numpy scipy matplotlib notebook IPython
   pip3 install tensorflow==2.3.2
   pip3 install pystoi pesq
   ```
